## Introduction
The Ecommerce Website project is developed to demonstrate the implementation of an ecommerce platform using Java Servlets for server-side programming and SQL for database management. It provides a simple yet functional web application for users to browse and purchase products online.

## Features
The project comes with the following key features:
- User Registration and Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
- Product Catalog: Browse and search for products by category, name, or other attributes.
- Product Details: View detailed information about each product, including images, descriptions, and pricing.
- Shopping Cart: Add products to the cart and manage the cart contents.
- Checkout and Payment: Proceed to the checkout process, enter shipping and payment information, and place orders.
- Order Management: Users can view their order history and track the status of their orders.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- Java Servlets: For handling server-side logic and request-response processing.
- SQL: For database management and data storage.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: For the frontend user interface and user experience.
- Apache Tomcat: As the web server to deploy and run the servlets.

## Setup
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) and Apache Tomcat installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/shoppingcart.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd shoppingcart`.
4. Deploy the project to Apache Tomcat. You can do this by copying the WAR file to the Tomcat webapps directory or using the Tomcat Manager web interface.
5. Start Apache Tomcat.
6. Access the application in your web browser by going to `http://localhost:8080/shopping*cart`.

## Database
The SQL script for creating the necessary database tables and sample data can be found in the `database` folder. You can use this script to set up the required database structure for the application.

Please make sure to configure the database connection parameters in the servlets accordingly to match your local database settings.
